# An Implementation of a React.js test task offered to me by the Future company on hh.ru

## Desktop only!

Created with **create-react app**, built with **webpack**

Here's the link to the task itself: https://github.com/fugr-ru/frontend-javascript-test

Sorry, I'm not gonna translate it.

Here I've learned and implemented features as:

+ table layout
+ fetching data from a server (**axios**)
+ sorting
+ pagination (**react-paginate**)
+ filtering
+ data manipulation in arrays and objects

All the good stuff, you know ;)

Oh and according to the spec the visual part is not a priority so I just threw in some bits of **Bootstrap** here and there.

You can play with the app here: https://lconstantine.github.io/test-react-table-app/

or get it running locally by cloning the repo and using the basic create-react-app script:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
